# Mental-health-project
## Introduction

THIS  is my frist project with code institute. it utilisesw HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create sing page website based on providing information to help improve mental health. the website can be accessed below.
[live website](https://aidan-99.github.io/Mental-health-project/#index.html)
## User stories

I based the website on 4 user stories which are as following:

1. As a working professional juggling career and family responsibilities, I need quick mindfulness exercises that fit into my busy schedule, so that I can manage stress effectively and stay emotionally balanced.

2. As someone seeking guidance, I want an intuitive contact page where I can reach out for personalized recommendations, so that I receive support tailored to my needs.

3. As a front-end developer, I want to create an intuitive and calming UI using ocean-inspired colors and accessible design principles, so that users can easily navigate stress-relief resources without feeling overwhelmed.

4. As a first-time visitor, I want a welcoming and easy-to-navigate homepage, so that I can quickly understand the site's purpose and find relevant stress-relief resources.

in order to fulfil the criteria of these user stories, i looked at eachone and fulfilled a set of criteria, in the same order:

1. for a working proffesional without much spare time on there hands, the website needed to provide quick tips for managing stress in an easy to access format. to achieve this, i implemented the use of bootstrap cards to provide a simple to follow lay out of quick tips.

2. to fulfil the user story of a person in need of personalised recomendations i implemented a modal form that llows an individual to sign up to the websites newsletter, as well as a contact us form in the footer of the site.

3. as a front-end developer looking to create a calming theme to the site inspired by the ocean, i implemented the use of ai generated imagery, as well as chose a ocean ispired colour palate, and a easy to navigate website utilising a navbar so that the site was both accesable and responsive.

4. to fulfil this section i implemented a nav bar at the top of the site that links to the relavent areas of the page, as well as implemented a simple about us section at the top of the page explaining the purpose of the site and its goals.



## Theme
### font and color 
in order to create a relaxed and simple theme i deiced to only use two fonts. i uses lato for the general text as the font is easy to read, but has a soft appearence that i belive suits the websites goal of providing stress relief. for the heading i used a font named edu SA hand as i belive its informality provides a relaxed introduction to each section, as well as standing out from the content. 

to select my color pallte, i experiemented with vqarious tools such as coolers before ultimately deciding on a pallete provided by microsfot co-pilot, which provided 5 different colors and their hex values prompted by a request for calming colors inspired by the ocean, hence my primary color was sky blue, my secondary color was sand, and for a third color to supporate any calls to action and navigation links i utilises a sky blue. i used a seperate colour for navigation elements and buttons to ensure the website was easy to follow.
### imagery 
i generated 5 images using microsoft designer, each image followed a the theme of a relaxing seashore. i utilised an image for the about section that i softened by styling it to be round, and then created 4 images based on that which related to the individual themes of each tip. for example the card that is titled mindful breathing contains an image of a yoga practioner meditating on a beach.

. 
## Deployment 
The website is deployed using github pages.

## Testing
to test the website i first used the google chrome WAVE extension tool. this showed no errors but did show alerts for the underlined text within the webpage. however, i belive the undelined titles provided better readability.
I also tested the webpage using the lighthouse extension which is linked below.
[Lighthouse validation](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-aidan-99-github-io-Mental-health-project/unn5v2rika?form_factor=desktop&category=performance&category=accessibility&category=best-practices&category=seo&hl=en-GB&utm_source=lh-chrome-ext)
i also used the W3C validator and foxed several small errors in the HTML file.
